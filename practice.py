# PART ONE

# 1. Write a function called 'hello_world' that does not take any arguments and
#    prints "Hello World".

def hello_world():
    """function prints 'hello world'

    function does not take any parameters and does not return anything. It only
    prints 'hello world'
    """

    print "Hello World"

# 2. Write a function called 'say_hi' that takes a name as a string and
#    prints "Hi" followed by the name

def say_hi(name):
    """function prints 'Hi' followed by the name

    function takes in a string parameter and binds it to the name variable.
    the string 'Hi' is printed followed by the name variable
    Nothing is returned
    """

    print "Hi " + name

# 3. Write a function called 'print_product' that takes two integers and multiplies
#    them together. Print the result

def print_product(num1, num2):
    """function takes in two integers and multiplies them together

    Two integers are passed into the parameter as num1 and num2. They are multiplied
    together and the result in printed. Nothing is returned
    """

    print num1 * num2



# 4. Write a function called 'repeat_string' that takes a string and an integer and
#    prints the string that many times


# 5. Write a function called 'print_sign' that takes an integer and prints "Higher
#    than 0" if higher than zero and "Lower than 0" if lower
#    than zero. If the integer is 0 print "Zero".


# 6. Write a function called 'is_divisible_by_three' that takes an integer and returns a
#    boolean (True or False), depending on whether the number
#    is evenly divisible by 3.


# 7. Write a function called 'num_spaces' that takes a sentence as one string and
#    returns the number of spaces.


# 8. Write a function called 'total_meal_price' that can be passed a meal price and a
#    tip percentage. It should return the total amount paid
#    (price + price * tip). **However:** passing in the tip
#    percentage should be optional; if not given, it should
#    default to 15%.


# 9. Write a function called 'sign_and_parity' that takes an integer as an argument and
#    returns two pieces of information as strings ---
#    "Positive" or "Negative" and "Even" or "Odd". The two strings
#    should be returned in a list.
#
#    Then, write code that shows the calling of this function
#    on a number and unpack what is returned into two
#    variables --- sign and parity (whether it's even or odd).
#    Print sign and parity.

# PART TWO

# 1. Turn the block of code from the directions into a function.
#    Take a name and a job title as parameters, making it so the
#    job title defaults to "Engineer" if a job title is not passed in.
#    Return the person's title and name in one string.

# 2. Given a recipient name & job title and a sender name,
#    print the following letter:
#
#       Dear JOB_TITLE RECIPIENT_NAME, I think you are amazing!
#       Sincerely, SENDER_NAME.
#
#    Use the function from #1 to construct the full title for the letter's
#    greeting.
